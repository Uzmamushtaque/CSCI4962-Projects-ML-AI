Rather the neurons compete for the right to respond to a subset of similar input data and push their weights closer to one of the input points. Learning process is also different from Backpropagation in Neural Networks.\n",

A common approach is to use the Euclidian distance between the input and the weight vector in order to compute the activation. Smaller distances lead to larger activation. The output unit that has the highest activation to a given input is declared the winner and moved closer to the input."
