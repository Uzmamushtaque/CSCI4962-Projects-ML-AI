Each step has their own parameters to be tuned. For example if step 1 does not give a good result we may want to focus on getting more data or choosing a good optimization algorithm. In step 2 if we do not get good results, then we might need to use regularization. In step 3 the remedy could be to get a bigger dev set or maybe choose a different model. Thinking of these remedies but according to these 3 different directions is sometimes referred to as orthogonalization. Basically depending on the issue you are facing motivates your remedy."

        "When selecting your evaluation metrics there are many aspects that must be taken into consideration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes selecting two evaluations metrics can be confusing for certain problems. For example Precision and Recall are defined in such a way that sometimes both have a trade-ff. Therefore, for one model you might get a good result for one metric and vice versa. One way to deal with this situation is to come up with a single evaluation metric that would encompass both (or all of your metrics). In this case it could be F1 score which is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another, way of combining metrics could be to formulate an optimization problem. If model accuracy and runtime are important for your model, then you can constrain your model by solving the maximizing accuracy problem subject to some maximum runtime constraint. This is useful in large neural networks that are achieving high accuracy at the expense of very high runtime."

For example if searching for $\\eta$ between 0.1 and 0.001 we first sample $log\\eta$ uniformly between -1 and -3 and then exponentiate to the power of 10. However, there are certain parameters that are searched in the uniform space."
