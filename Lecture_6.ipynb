        "If the model performs well on all three steps then we are in an ideal world. Usually this is not the case, therefore we need to fine tune our model at each step. Each step has their own parameters to be tuned. For example if step 1 does not give a good result we may want to focus on getting more data or choosing a good optimization algorithm. In step 2 if we do not get good results, then we might need to use regularization. In step 3 the remedy could be to get a bigger dev set or maybe choose a different model. Thinking of these remedies but according to these 3 different directions is sometimes referred to as orthogonalization. Basically depending on the issue you are facing motivates your remedy."
