        "Neural networks are designed in such a way that input features are largely independent of one another. However, there are certain datatypes that have sequential dependencies. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Time Series Data: Values on successive time stamps are closely related to one another. Every successive value cannot be considered being independent form the other because in time-series data each value is dependent on the previous one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Textual Data: Usually text is treated as a bag of words until recently there is greater emphasis on the ordering of the words used for better semantic insights. It is important to construct a model that takes sequential information into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Biological Data: This comprises of sequences of symbols corresponding to amino acids that form building blocks of DNA."
